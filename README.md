Sometimes I like to get wine drunk and solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. All solutions are guaranteed two (or three) sheets to the wind.

## Usage

### "IDE"
Launch configuration for VS Code is included for Debug Pane usage. You aren't still using Sublime, are you?

### CLI
```bash
$ yarn solve <n>
```

**NO CHEATING / SPOILER ALERT**

If you haven't solved them already, turn away.
